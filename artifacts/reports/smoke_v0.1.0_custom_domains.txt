SSL CERTIFICATE STATUS
======================
✅ Fly.io API: Valid SSL certificate (app-ezgnqzzi.fly.dev)
⚠️  Vercel Marketing: Authentication required (cannot verify SSL)
❌ Custom domains: Not configured (no SSL certificates)

SUMMARY
=======
Total Tests: 10
Passed: 2 (API docs on Fly.io, vatevo.com/vida on Squarespace)
Failed: 6 (Custom domains not configured)
Skipped: 2 (Health endpoints not implemented, Status endpoint not deployed)

STATUS: PARTIAL PASS
- API docs working on Fly.io base URL
- Custom domains require DNS configuration
- Health endpoints not implemented
- Status endpoint needs deployment

NEXT STEPS
==========
1. Configure DNS records for all custom domains
2. Deploy API with health endpoints and status endpoint
3. Configure Vercel domain bindings
4. Configure Fly.io custom domain
5. Re-run smoke tests against custom domains
6. Verify SSL certificates are issued

BLOCKING ISSUES
===============
- DNS configuration not completed
- Custom domains not accessible
- Health endpoints not implemented
- Status endpoint not deployed

RECOMMENDATIONS
===============
1. Complete DNS cutover before final release
2. Deploy API updates to enable all endpoints
3. Configure Vercel authentication bypass for marketing site
4. Test all custom domains after DNS propagation
5. Verify SSL certificates are valid across all domains
