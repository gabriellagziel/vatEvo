## Next Steps

1. **Review PR**: Examine the imported code and test results
2. **Local Testing**: Run tests locally to verify functionality
3. **CI Verification**: Ensure GitHub Actions pipeline passes
4. **Production Planning**: Plan deployment strategy and infrastructure
5. **Feature Development**: Begin implementing Phase 2 features

The Vatevo MVP is now fully imported with comprehensive testing infrastructure and CI/CD pipeline ready for further development.
